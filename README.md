# TPS Mod - How to install - v2.x.x
This mod is for Minecraft Forge for Minecraft v1.7.10-v1.13.2

To install, download both the litlaunch version for the minecraft version you want, and the tpsmod version you want
Drag-and-drop the litlaunch jar into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.

If you are installing for 1.13 or above, put the tpsmod jar into a new folder named, "mods-litlaunch", without the quotes
If you are installing for pre-1.13, put the tpsmod jar into the mods folder, in the same directory as the litlaunch jar

You may ignore the "This kind of file may harm your computer" messages, as those are shown for all jar files
