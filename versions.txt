v1.1: January 26th 2019
Additions:
	-added the command /tpstoall is added which gets the tps and shares it to everyone
	-including actual client size commands, which means less lag b/w doing /tps and getting the tps, and /tpstoall and getting the tps and sharing it
	-you can do /tps help and /tpstoall help to see the command usage of the command.
Bug-Fixes:
	-No more weird tps things upon your first /tps per log-in to a world
Bugs:
	-I does introduce a bug where typing "tps" into chat insteads executes the command "/tps" instead of entering "tps" into chat.

v1.2: May 27th 2019

Changes:
	-The mod now uses forge events to check, for example, if a world is loading, instead of guessing and checking to see if the world is loaded
	-//tps and //tpstoall has more readable and advanced code behind it.
	-You now must type //tps instead of just /tps. Sorry!
Bug-Fixes:
	-Don't remember exactly, though there is probably a bunch behind the scenes.
	-No longer gives you the tps if you type in "tps" in chat, respectively for alltps
Bugs:
	-Turns out that the weird tps output is still there. :O :P (fixed in version 2.0)
	
v2.0: To Come

A complete re-write of the code. Compatible with many versions of Minecraft and Modloaders. Will come when ready.
The latest source is at https://www.github.com/Codetoil/TPS-Mod-Source if you want a pre-mature build. Not compiled though, you will have to compile it yourself.



Betas:

v1.2 Beta 1: January 30th 2019

Changes:
	-/tps and /tpstoall commands more sophisticated
	-now must use //tps and //tpstoall to activate commands. This prevents you from typing "tps" into chat and being executed as the "/tps" command.
	
	-WorldLogger renamed to ClientWorldLogger
	-Many debug infos now reduced to debugs
	-Uses built-in triggers for world loading and unloading
	-Removal of class "Ads"
Bug-Fixes:
	-Plenty of small things that I can't think of after this long day.
Left in debug features:
	-When you launch a game with this, in the chat it states "Thread". This was a left in debug feature that I intended to remove. Doesn't effect the gameplay at all, so it doesn't matter anyway.
-Incomplete atm
